# Node Live Text-to-Speech Starter

This example app demonstrates how to use the Deepgram Text-to-Speech API over WebSockets with Node.

The flow of this sample is:

1. A websocket is opened from the UI to the backend Javascript component
1. Text is sent over a websocket to the backend component
1. If a connection has not been established to Deepgram, create a websocket connection using the Javascript SDK and send the text to convert to audio
1. An audio byte response with synthesized text-to-speech is returned and forward back through the WebSocket created by the UI
1. Those audio bytes are then played by the media device contained within your browser
